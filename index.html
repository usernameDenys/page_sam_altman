                <h3>Career</h3>
            </div>
            <article>In 2005, at the age of 19, Altman co-founded Loopt, a location-based social networking mobile
                application. As CEO, Altman raised more than $30 million in venture capital for the company; however,
                Loopt failed to gain traction with enough users. In March 2012, it was acquired by the Green Dot
                Corporation for $43.4 million. The following month, Altman co-founded Hydrazine Capital with his
                brother, Jack Altman.<br><br>
                Altman became a partner at Y Combinator in 2011, initially working there on a part-time basis. In
                February 2014, Altman was named president of Y Combinator by its co-founder, Paul Graham. In a 2014 blog
                post, Altman said that the total valuation of Y Combinator companies had surpassed $65 billion,
                including Airbnb, Dropbox, Zenefits, and Stripe. In September 2016, Altman announced his expanded role
                as president of YC Group, which included Y Combinator and other units. Altman said that he hoped to
                expand Y Combinator to fund 1,000 new companies per year. He also tried to expand the types of companies
                funded by YC, especially "hard technology" companies. In October 2015, Altman announced YC Continuity, a
                $700 million equity fund investing in YC companies as they matured. A week earlier, Altman had
                introduced Y Combinator Research, a non-profit research lab, and donated $10 million to fund it. YC
                Research has thus far announced research on basic income, the future of computing, education, and
                building new cities. In March 2019, YC announced Altman's transition from the president of the company
                to a less hands-on role as Chairman of the Board, for him to focus on OpenAI. This decision came shortly
                after YC announced it would be moving its headquarters to San Francisco. As of early 2020, he was no
                longer affiliated with YC <br><br>
                Altman co-founded Tools For Humanity in 2019, a company which builds and distributes systems to designed
                to scan people's eyes to provide authentication and verify proof of personhood to counter fraud. People
                who agree to have their eyes scanned are compensated with a cryptocurrency called Worldcoin.Tools For
                Humanity describes its cryptocurrency as similar to universal basic income.
